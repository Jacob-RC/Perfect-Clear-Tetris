<h1> FAQ </h1>
<h4> How does Perfect Clear work?</h4> 
Perfect Clear uses Java's built in visualization features to generate various Tetris puzzles to practice full clears. solutions.txt is a plain text file that have each possible solution pre-generated for various numbers of pieces. Main.java reads each line in solutions.txt file and generates the corresponding patterns and pieces based off the raw data.
<br>
<h4> How are solutions generated? </h4>
Solutions were pre-generated for various piece counts using a specialized program that manually calculates each scenario and outputs it into a solutions.txt file.
<br>
<h4> Are there any future plans for P4rfect Clear or is this everything? </h4>
We plan to keep updating both the current files as well as expand into more areas in the future. We're currently looking to add more features to the existing program as well as start work on a website where people can practice in their browser.
